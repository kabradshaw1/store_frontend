# React, TypeScript, Redux, Django, and PostgreSQL server

## Purpose
This project is for the purpose of learning about integrating these three technolgies: Django, PostgreSQL, and React.  It will also use Django Restframework, axios and SWR.  As I've gone on to add more, this project has added some TypeScript, React-Redux, Redux/toolkit, React-Hook-Form, and Yup during the process of learning another method of authentication.
